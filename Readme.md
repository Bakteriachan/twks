# Terminal Workspaces

  So, in my day-to-day work, I use curl as an API client, is more simple
for me than using Insomnia or Postman. Sometimes i need to copy some
data so I can build my http headers, like authentication header, I need
to reference some documents in the URI (`/users/(userId)`), and the job
of copy-pasting every time i need to build a new curl command is to
tedius for me. So that is why I built <strong>Terminal Workspaces</strong>,
 so i can
use some variables and reuse them between different terminal sessions that
I am currently running.

## How to build
  This tool only depends on <a href="https://github.com/json-c/json-c">libjson-c</a> to access
the workspace keys and values. On ubuntu it can be installed with
```
apt install libjson-c-dev
```
On archlinux
```
pacman -S libjson-c
``` 
  Just run `make` command, which builds `twks` executable, you can
copy this executable to `~/.local/bin` or any other folder you like.
